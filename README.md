> As *possible solutions*, we provide only one possible syntax that may fit the requirements at least in a special situation. Thus, some exercises can be solved in different ways, with miscellaneous differences in the outputs. This is why the *possible solutions* do not replace the lab instructors' explanations, and all rights reserved about future complaints.
